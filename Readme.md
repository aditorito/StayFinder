# 🏡 StayFinder

**StayFinder** is a full-stack Airbnb-like platform for discovering and hosting vacation rentals. Users can browse luxurious stays, view detailed property info, and hosts can list their own properties with image uploads via Cloudinary.

This project was built as part of an internship application and personal learning. I’m actively seeking collaboration opportunities, internships, or open-source projects to grow with like-minded developers.
